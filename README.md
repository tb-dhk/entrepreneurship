## the food:pod project

the food:pod project is a collaborative effort by students from hwa chong institution aimed at tackling food wastage through innovative technology. it comprises three main components: the app, the bin, and the ai model.

## components

- **food:pod**: a smart food waste bin utilizing image recognition to identify and weigh deposited food items, integrating with the ai model for waste analysis and tracking.
